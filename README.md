# AxzonConnect

AxzonConnect allows a seamless integration of Axzon sensors and temperature loggers with Cloud and IoT platforms. 

This integration facilitates Enterprise Data Collection, which in turns enables further applications like Analytics and AI information systems. AxzonConnect is built using the Zebra IoT Connector for fixed RFID readers framework. Therefore, AxzonConnect executes in the reader itself, under its Linux-based operating system in a completely standalone environment as an edge device.

### There are two editions of AxzonConnect:
- AxzonConnect Magnus Edition, intended for Magnus® S3 based sensors
- AxzonConnect Opus Edition, intended for Opus™ IC based temperature loggers
